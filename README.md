# sdl-to-wasm-games
A compilation of games built with C and SDL compiled to WebAssembly through [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

## Games
For now, only two games are added: Snake and Asteroids. Both games are written in C with SDL, and are compiled to WebAssembly through Emscripten.

## Previews
